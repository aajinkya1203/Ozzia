# Ozzia
_A personal space to share, discuss and comment!_

A website which helps you connect to all the people around the world while at the same time your friends too!
So do whatever you can, like, comment, post, follow/unfollow, the services are there for free! :wink:

>This is a solo project made by me and is made entirely with MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS (MERN Stacks). Look at the Credits part for more details on me and my other projects!
